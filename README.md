## Overview
This is the public release of BBN's MAGIC source code.  MAGIC is an ongoing four year research program into the creation of an AI embedded into an AR goggle set that assists on specific doman tasks.  This work is funded by DARPA and this is termed referred to as the perceptual task guidance (PTG) program. 

## About PTG
Information about PTG can be found in the [press](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2023-01-25), at the [DARPA website](https://www.darpa.mil/program/perceptually-enabled-task-guidance), or by reading the original [BAA](https://research-authority.tau.ac.il/sites/resauth.tau.ac.il/files/DARPA-PTG-%20HR001121S0015.pdf).

DARPA structured the research into three groups of researchers, TA1, TA2, TA3. The TA1 researchers are performing work in the areas perceptual grounding, perceptual attention (enviromental modeling), user modeling, task grounding, and knowledge transfer. 

BBN is a TA2 poerformer.  Our goal is to take the work of TA1 and build a system suited for a DoD task.  Our selected domain is medicine.  This means we are creating an AI/AR tool that understands 50 medical skills, understands how they are performed, can watch you doing them, and provide medcial assistance, guidance, instruction and correction (MAGIC!).
